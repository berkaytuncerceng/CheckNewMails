# CheckNewMails

A program written in C# that checks the specified email address every 5 minutes for new emails. When a new email arrives, it writes the email details to a file using Newtonsoft.Json for serialization. Additionally, if the email has attachments, it downloads them and saves them to a separate attachments file using MailKit.
